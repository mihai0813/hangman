# Hangman

## Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

A class Hangman has been created to achieve this.

This project was built for the AiCore Data Analyst bootcamp in order to practice python programming skills.
This project has given me the opportunity to better my understanding on builiding python classes and functions.
